    <h1>fundamental forces</h1>
    <pre> Fundamental forces in physics (sometimes called interaction forces) are the forces by which the simplest particles in the world interact with each other.
We call a force "fundamental" when it cannot be described by other forces. 
The four known fundamental forces are:
<b>the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, the electromagnetic force, and gravity.</b>
Strong and weak nuclear forces are also known as strong and weak forces, respectively.
Probably, except for gravity, the rest of these forces can be described by a series of approximate calculations known as perturbation theory. 
However, there are also cases where the disturbance theory cannot describe the observed phenomenon well. Such <abbr title="In mathematics and physics, a soliton is a self-amplifying isolated wave (a wave packet or pulse) that maintains its shape when traveling at a constant speed.">single wave</abbr> .</pre>

    <h3 style="background-color:rgb(0, 102, 255)">Gravity</h3> 
    <pre style="background-color: rgb(127, 150, 255);"><i>Gravity</i> is a natural phenomenon in which all objects with mass attract each other. The effect of gravity on these bodies, 
that is, the effect of the attraction of a massed body on another massed body, or in a simpler understanding, each body on another body; And we see it as a weight on us.

One of the most familiar manifestations of gravity is the falling of an apple from a tree or the attraction of the weight of physical objects and 
the application of downward force on them. 
The phenomenon of gravity usually occurs on large or very large scales when the mass of at least one of the bodies involved is very high; 
Therefore, the manifestations of gravity can be seen in the movement of celestial bodies and the path of the planets around the sun.</pre>

    <h3 style="background-color: rgb(173, 84, 245);">Electromagnetism</h3>
   <pre style="background-color: rgb(199, 136, 250);"><i>Electromagnetism</i> is the force that acts between electrically charged particles. This phenomenon includes the electrostatic force acting between charged particles at rest, 
and the combined effect of electric and magnetic forces acting between charged particles moving relative to each other.

Electromagnetism has an infinite range, as gravity does, but is vastly stronger. It is the force that binds electrons to atoms, and it holds molecules together. 
It is responsible for everyday phenomena like light, magnets, electricity, and friction. Electromagnetism fundamentally determines all macroscopic, and many atomic-level, 
properties of the chemical elements.</pre>

    <h3 style="background-color: rgb(235, 75, 123);">Weak interaction</h3>
    <pre style="background-color: rgb(255, 133, 163);">The <i>weak interaction</i> or <i>weak nuclear force</i> is responsible for some nuclear phenomena such as beta decay. Electromagnetism and the weak force are now 
understood to be two aspects of a unified electroweak interaction â€” this discovery was the first step toward the unified theory known as the Standard Model.</pre>
<hr>
    <h3 style="background-color: rgb(255, 72, 87);">Strong interaction</h3>
    <pre style="background-color: rgb(255, 98, 98);">The strong interaction, or strong nuclear force, is the most complex of the fundamental interactions, mostly because its value changes with distance. 
At distances greater than 10 femtometres, the strong force is practically non-absorbable, and this force only acts in the nucleus of the atom. When the nucleus of the atom was 
discovered in 1905, it was clear that another force was needed to counteract the electrostatic repulsion caused by the positive charges inside the nucleus. If this force did not exist, 
the nucleus of the atom would never be formed. The strong force must be strong enough to fit protons into an atom in a volume of 10 <sup>15</sup>. </pre>
